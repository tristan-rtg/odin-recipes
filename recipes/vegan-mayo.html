  <!-- Introduction --->
    <p>
        If you are travelling a lot then you may already have noticed that it's sometimes hard to get your favorite foods in vegan options.
        I experienced this a lot with mayonnaise. 
        And also if I managed to find a vegan option it tasted bad or was really expensive
    </p>
    <p>
        But I have really good news if you had the same problem.
        Because it's really easy to make vegan Mayonnaise on your own.
        If you're interested you simply need to follow along the steps below.
