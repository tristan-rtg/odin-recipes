        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups arborio rice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white wine (optional)</li>
            <li>4 cups vegetable broth, kept warm</li>
            <li>2 cups mixed mushrooms, sliced (such as cremini, shiitake, and oyster)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegan butter</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute. Add the arborio rice and toast for 2-3 minutes, 
                stirring frequently.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in the white wine, if using, and cook until it's mostly absorbed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Begin adding the warm vegetable broth, one ladle at a time, stirring constantly. Allow the liquid to 
                be absorbed before adding more. This process should take about 20-25 minutes until the rice is creamy and 
                al dente.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate pan, sauté the mushrooms in a bit of olive oil until they release their juices and become tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir the cooked mushrooms, nutritional yeast, and vegan butter into the risotto. Season with salt and 
                pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Garnish with fresh parsley and serve hot.
            </li>
        </ol>
